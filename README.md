##<a name="gameplayoverview"></a>Gameplay Overview

This game will be a classic side scroller 2D shooter that would resemble games such as Metal Slug and Contra. The story is not currently set, I have been debating with several ideas that revolve around a Rambo-like story of infiltrating an enemy compound, either saving people and blowing something up (or both), and facing a boss.

##<a name="gameplaymechanics"></a>Gameplay Mechanics

Class arcade style of 2D Shooter Platformer. Main focus is to utilize a Xbox controller to control the movement and aiming with separate joysticks.

Sample gameplay can be found in my [Weekly Blog Posts](#posts) and will constantly be updated on my thought process of the game until release.

Following Unity's [Xbox360 Controller Mapping](http://wiki.unity3d.com/images/a/a7/X360Controller2.png):

    - Left Joystick
      - Movement of player
    - Right Joystick
      - Alignment of weapon
    - A
      - Jump
    - B
      - Grenades (Maybe aimable and changed)
